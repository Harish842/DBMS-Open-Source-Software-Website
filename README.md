# DBMS-Open-Source-Software-Website

I've successfully completed an engaging project as part of my DBMS course: an Open Source Software website. ðŸŽ“ðŸ’» I have used HTML and CSS for a user-friendly front end, and tapping into the power of MySQL and PHP for the dynamic backend, I've had the opportunity to explore the fusion of design and data management.

# Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the website's content.
- CSS: Used for styling and layout design.
- MySQL: Employed for the backend database management.
- PHP: Used to create dynamic web pages and interact with the database.
